# Phase-4-Project

# Sentiment Analysis of Tweets on Brands and Products

## Description
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of tweets about various brands and products. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we extract insights from textual data to understand public perception and sentiment towards different brands and products on social media.

## Steps to Reproduce

### 1. Data Acquisition
- Download the dataset from the provided source [here](https://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone/).
- Alternatively, you can use your own dataset if available.

### 2. Data Exploration
- Load the dataset into a DataFrame.
- Explore the structure of the dataset.
- Identify the columns available in the dataset and their meanings.
- Check for any missing values or inconsistencies in the data.
- Explore the distribution of sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral) if available.
- Analyze the distribution of tweets across brands or products.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values (if any).
- Remove duplicate rows.
- Clean the text data by removing special characters, punctuation, and stopwords.
- Convert text data into lowercase.

### 4. Text Vectorization
- Convert the preprocessed text data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.
- Techniques like TF-IDF vectorization or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) can be used for text vectorization.

## Results
- After data preprocessing and vectorization:
  - The TF-IDF matrix has been generated with appropriate dimensions.
  - Word vectors have been generated using Word2Vec embeddings.

## Installation
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (e.g., Python, pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, gensim).
- Follow the steps outlined in the project to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
